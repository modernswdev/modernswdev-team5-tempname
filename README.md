## Project Idea
The idea for this project is for a service request tracker, such as one for an IT or maintenance department.
### The Problem
Many requests for service happen in computer-related fields, and trying to keep track of these requests by hand, or by using software not intended for this purpose, could lead to problems. Such problems could include losing track of the transaction dates of requests, leading to some requests not being serviced in a reasonable amount of time, or losing track of the status of requests, leading to some requests needing to be checked again to make sure that they have or have not been serviced.
## The Mission Statement
Our piece of software would be able to help track and manage service requests. The intended users of this software would those working in an IT or maintenance department, who need to work with service requests.
### The Solution
Our project, as a piece of software dedicated to being for tracking service requests, would help to alleviate the pain points of less specialized methods of tracking requests. This would be achieved by having relatively easy-to-use options for interacting with a service request database, such as being able to create service requests, close requests, view and sort requests, update requests, and more.
