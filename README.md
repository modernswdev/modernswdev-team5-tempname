## Project Idea

## The Mission Statement

## Team Workflow

To simulate a real-world Scrum environment, our team will follow a structured workflow.

### Definition of Done (DoD)
A task will be considered “Done” when:
- The feature is fully implemented.
- The code is pushed to a feature branch.
- A Pull Request is created.
- At least one teammate reviews and approves it.
- The feature works without errors.
- The README is updated if necessary.

Only after approval will the feature be merged into the `main` branch.

### Communication & Meeting Cadence

### Communication & Meeting Cadence

We will use Slack as our main communication platform and maintain a dedicated channel for Team 5. All updates, questions, and important information will be shared there to keep everyone informed.

Our team will meet once per week, either via Slack or Zoom. During these meetings, we will review what each member worked on and discuss overall progress. If necessary, we may schedule additional meetings, but at minimum we will meet weekly.

### Branching Strategy
To avoid merge conflicts, we will use a feature branch strategy.
- The `main` branch will always remain stable.
- Each feature will be developed in its own branch.
- Example branch names:
  - `feature/user-login`
  - `feature/create-ticket`
  - `feature/dashboard`

After completing a feature, a Pull Request will be created to merge it into `main`.

### Pull Request Policy
- No one will push directly to the `main` branch.
- Every change must go through a Pull Request.
- At least one team member must review and approve the PR.
- Feedback must be addressed before merging.
